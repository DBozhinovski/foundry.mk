# Our services

Foundry provides software development expertise in transforming a business idea into an MVP or a Prototype. Our team seamlessly integrates with our clients’ vision and in-house teams to scale-up their production.

## Custom product development

Minimum viable products (MVP) and Prototypes are a great way to test your business idea directly on the market. Our product development follows strict production protocols and guidelines – we provide fully documented, scalable, and easily maintainable products. Foundry has substantial experience and expertise in developing and delivering software solutions which incorporate the latest industry standards and technologies.

### Progressive Web Applications

PWA’s are the next generation of web applications which can be distributed to a wide range of devices. Connectivity independent, fast, responsive, and always fresh – they can serve a larger user-base regardless of the internet quality and coverage.

### Distributed & P2P systems

We are experts in creating solutions for distributed systems that are scalable, efficient, and offer superior performance compared to standard monolithic systems – bettering the experience for the end-user. Additionally, we're firm believers in P2P - the ultimate expression of a distributed system

### Serverless Solutions

Here at Foundry, we like to focus and invest in the usability and the functionality of the product without having to poke a hole in your pocket on server maintenance. It’s a cheaper, automatically scalable, event-driven architecture that is perfectly suitable for a wide array of projects.

It is a novel, revolutionary architecture for delivering faster, safer, optimized websites without relying on complex, monolithic architectures – instead delivering dynamic content via APIs and micro-services. It integrates and supports the newest workflows, tools, and best practices of modern web development!
