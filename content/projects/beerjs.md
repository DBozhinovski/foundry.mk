## About the project

BeerJS is an international meetup for beer and JavaScript enthusiasts. As big believers in community, we support it wholeheartedly.
That includes a web page for the Skopje meetup of the chapter, which we also regularly sponsor. Have a look at https://beerjs.mk ☺️

## Technology used

The web page is built with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/), which means it's also built with using **React** and **GraphQL**. The page itself
is a Progressive Web Application, which means a lot, especially when it comes to performance, regardless of the device it's being used
on.
